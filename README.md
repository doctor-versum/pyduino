# pyduino
This is a work-in-progress python library to control a connected arduino over serial.

# Supported devices:

- Arduino Uno R3
  - fully supported
 
- Any other Arduino and Arduino-like device
  - probably works, but there is no garatee. Also, the automatic port detection only works with arduino unos.

# Usage

first, download the arduino remote Firmware. it can be found in is the "Arduino_remote_v<version\>.ino" file. but make sure, you also copy the folder around it. otherwise, you are going to get an error from the arduino ide. the second step is, to upload the Arduino remote firmware to the arduino. Open the Arduino IDE on your system of choice and open the Project. You can change some varibeles at the top, but it is NOT recommendet, if you don't know, what you are doing. Then, just press upload.

then, import ArduinoUnoR3 module:

```python
from pyduino import ArduinoUnoR3
arduino = ArduinoUnoR3(port_input, baudrate, pin_config)
```
*port_input is only needed, if you have multiple arduinos connected at the same time.*

*baudrate can also be left out, if you haven't changed the baudrate in the Arduinos Firmware.*

*pin_config is also no requirenment. The librarys basic functions work without it, but you have to define the pins, if you want to actually control something or read from pins. more information in the [documentation](https://github.com/back-from-black/pyduino/blob/main/docs/work_in_progress.md)*

and lastly, connect to the Arduino:

```python
arduino.connect()
```

Thats it. there is more you can do, but thats all, you have to do, to get the library to work.

# Optional

import the Management module:

```python
from pyduino import Management
settings = Management()
```
and now, you can change the logging and probably later also some other settings.
```python
settigns.set_logging(5)
```
A full explenation on, what every level does, is available in the [documentation](https://github.com/back-from-black/pyduino/blob/main/docs/logging.md).
